      "personal best through the first sector for hajer for Albin for stroll for Coda for SS and for Gabriel bort letto the has is yet to push on B's in the first sector okon is on an out laap he's going to be last over the line Alvin improves to p8 so Lawson down to 13th and he's backed off this lap he may just about have time for another one but it's going to be tight L Norris went out there and improved his first and third sectors he is ahead by 3/10 of a second pressure lap time this for Carlos SS who comes over the line goes ahead of his teammate and finds his way into the next part of the session improvements coming from loads of those further back as well Lawson now 15th and he I don't think he has started a flying lap this could be it for Lawson fifth for haar is a superb effort ninth for Lance stroll Yuki Coda is in the drop zone Gabriel boretto is pushing on the racing ball car is up to ninth position Gabriel boretto made it through into Q2 sq2 at the moment is possible because he's got to 14th so Lawson is gone 18th and he's pitted disaster continues for Liam Lawson the two H cars started their laps very late and we r on board with Ole bman gazley is done he's in the drop zone hulkenberg is improving as well they're all pushing they're all on personal bests and they need it one house over the line and going to ninth position what a lap when it counted for Oliver bman who now drops Jack Duan into the Drop Zone along with his teammate Pier gazley bort letto on the the bubble let's see whether hulkenberg can get past whether he can out qualify his teammate in this format hulkenberg can't find the time he's out what about estan oon he improves to 18th but he can't make it either just understad wide at turn n and it is an under steering juicing Corner that you've got to wait for the front to turn he you can see the steering lock on and he's just tried to squeeze on the gas but he's run too far off the the road there lost the the traction of the rear tires and that is Lawson done that was estan okon putting a wheel on the gravel coming through the 16th and final turn he's been out qualified by his new teammate Oliver bman and it's Doan gazley okon hulkenberg and Liam Lawson is 20th in the red ball Hamilton's out there and he is on Norris's Pace in the middle sector so this is more like it then from Hamilton we have seen that he's been able to match Norris first lap not so much now he's got the is fired up and it's working alonso's first sector once again is really good his middle sector is decent so it's looking good for Fernando Alonso good teamwork from the racing Bulls a slipstream orchestrated on the long back straight here for Yuki Coda every second helps every tenth of a second helps around this circuit and it's the fourth fastest time for the Japanese driver and L strol goes ahead of him into P4 at the moment one year ago Aston Martin were in the top three on the grid around here Lewis Hamilton finds the top three he's 210 of a second second back compared to the Benchmark set by Lando Norris charlot Clair doesn't have the pace of his teammate at the moment he's only in fifth what about the rest of the order Fernando Alonzo makes it into the top eight he's ahead of both Mercedes yeah Mercedes slipping down need to find a bit of something bman gets into the top 10 as well but everyone behind is improving super lap from Oliver bman who is really having a better time it in round two compared to round one signs is not going to make it into the top 10 shootout neither is Gabriel bort letto he's gone into 13th position Alex alour was a star in Melbourne he's a star in Shanghai a superb lap to go ahead of the Ferrari of charlot Clair Coda is in eighth Alonzo is in ninth 10th for Oliver bman who was this man's teammate when it came to Formula 2 last year but it's Antonelli who finds the fourth fastest time and knocks out the H driver Russell is next up he was behind antelli he rookie teammate before he comes across the line he's second fastest ahead of the m of Oscar pastri this is where haar's chance of sq3 disappeared if you haven't driven the circuit before it is pretty specialist coming through this first turn it goes on and on and on and you got to go through five gears before you just pick it up there at turn three Alonso bman signs bort letto and haar are out Lewis Hamilton the rear moving around on the exit of turn 13 they desperate to stand on the power and take all the momentum they can onto this long straight with the DRS open piastri is in the mix as well this is going to be hundreds if not thousandths of a second as we come over the line Hamilton has the middle and it's the best one the middle sector is the best of anyone out there one minute to go still a battle rages between the Ferraris and the McLaren well Lewis Hamilton go to the top he will by 800s of a second Norris is going quickly though through the middle part of the lap here's charlot Clair to the line the Ferrari cuts the beam and goes to third he's two10 back on what his new teammate could do now pastri and Norris are the only drivers who can get in the mix when it comes to Hamilton pastri misses out and Lando Norris is in the background Lando Norris is pitting and Lewis Hamilton has found a lap time to take him top canvas Sten take Sprint pole it's only to start at the front for a 9 lap race but it's so competitive and once again Formula 1 is not following the script how about the world champion does he take it away from Lewis Hamilton OH he misses out by less than 200s of a second and the two Titans are at the front of the field there's a seven time world champion and a four-time world champion welcome to Ferrari Lewis Hamilton he's the driver to beat in the opening Sprint of the year over the line goes Alvin to eighth position Yuki Coda will complete our order He's Got The Hairpin at 14 Hamilton vapen pastri llaa Russell Norris in sixth no one would have predicted that now where does Yuki slot into this order as we complete our top 10 eighth place is a great lap where are we that's San dieago really yeah good job San Diego San Diego Mega job woo and that is why Lando pitted he was on for a for a pole lap had to throw everything out in the final Corners you have to take some risk and he's made a big mistake Sith on the grid Max of stappen not with the pace overall he's only 200 of a second away and the support that Lewis Hamilton has is outrageous",

      "what's up noj developers welcome back to another live stream super excited for today's build that I prepare for you because we're going to build something really beautiful and eye-catching today we are going to clone the Apple invites application so long story short this month Apple launched a new application called Apple invites which uh allows you to create and host events and send invites to your people so nothing to revolutionary however the way they implemented it in terms of UI and animation it's really impressive and today I want to uh challenge myself and see if we can build this one together so here is the application it has like a lot of blurs it has a lot of animations um you can create events you can invite people and that's what we're going to try to uh try to build today if you are new to re native this is a great opportunity for you to learn more about building beautiful UI and also dipping your toes into animations today we're going to learn a lot about animations with rect uh Native reanimated and also about gesture handling so that we can uh put together gestures with animations with beautiful UI uh and in then we're going to have a nice application also everything that you're going to learn today you can apply to your applications as well for example if you're building an event management app or in general in any application I think you can learn a lot today and apply and um 10x your user experience uh the thing that we're going to start with is going to be the welcome screen and when you just open the application don't have any events this is what you are greeted with very nice animations with a welcome message and the Showcase of different events cards I think this is really good onboarding screen it doesn't involve a lot of onboarding steps it's just one screen with nice animation that gives you a good understanding of what this application is and here at the top is an automated um scroll scroll view horizontally that we can also interact with and scroll ourself but if we release it automatically slowly moves along so we're going to start with this one uh today I spend the whole day preparing just this uh marqu uh component that would do the scrolling and I'm very excited with how it turned out and I want to share this with you later in the video we're going to get into other screens as well if we have time uh to create the forms the user interface the cards the displays and so on so if you're ready we can get started and let's run the intro [Music] hello everyone who is joining us live how are you doing guys hello roel ad Eric Vladimir uh Ado ruie how are you guys so let me put this one on the side we're going to come back to it a bit later and now let's go ahead and initialize a new project I'm going to open up my terminal let's go ahead and zoom in a bit I'm going to move to my projects YouTube um this week I've been heavily working on uh the the last project for R native Mastery uh our premium course projects YouTube 2025 here should be 02 invites and let's go ahead and start um initializing a new project we can do that using uh create Expo app or we can do that with create Expo stack which is an open-source um utility that helps us bootstrap and initialize a new exper project and what I like about it is that it's going to allow me to choose native wind and it's going to come preconfigured with Native wind in exper router so after we execute this command we're going to have to give a name so let's give it a name um invites would you like to use typ scrip let's leave yes yes here let's choose export router uh and a stch navigator and let's choose native wind for The Styling Library uh no State management for now no authentication and no yeah yes and just like that we're going to have a new uh fresh project set up with Native wind for styling if you're new to Native wind I'm going to explain that in a second and also with Expo router so as I was saying um if you haven't already check it out reative Mastery is the course that I've been working for more than a year and I've putting all my energy into into this course now I'm finishing up the last module but this course is based on seven different projects so it's Project based and it will teach you the text stack behind the top applications here I'm I'm teaching R native expo Expo router with typescript of course Zoo stand for State Management T query for remote data for fetching and caching remote data reanimated and gesture Handler which we're going to use today as well so seven different projects and in the end you have a lot of projects to put into your portfolio and you have knowledge to build any kind of rack native applications so if you're interested check it out at noes. devra Native Mastery uh and meanwhile our project has finished initializing and and I'm going to open it in cursor uh by saying cursor invites so cursor is a fork of Visual Studio code that has some additional AI features so nothing more than thiss code just a couple of things related to Ai and nowadays I actually find myself using uh AI to generate code more and more often and I'm just like looking around and making sure it does what what I want it to do but today I'm going to try to explain as much as possible stop at things and um um help you understand everything that we are doing let's go ahead and open a terminal here and in the terminal I will do npm start to start the development server in Expo this is the Metro server that is um that is executing or bundling our JavaScript site for our application and now we can either press I to open it on iOS simulator or a to open it on Android simulator but for that you need a little bit of environment setup so you need xcode and or Android Studio if you don't have V and if this is the first time you're working with Expo all you have to do is download the Expo go application from App Store or playm Market on your physical device and scan this QR code and you're going to to be good to go you're going to see the application running directly on your phone for now I'm going to use here the emulator so that you can see it as well and in a second we should see the first screen is that blur view safe to use an Android phones we're going to use Expo blur and I think if I'm not mistaken Expo blur works on Android adid is saying hardly welcome Lucas to the team yes thank you very much Lucas is preparing the the bill for next week so all right here we have our home screen and let me show you a little bit about the files that we're going to interact with most with so the app directory this is one of the most important folders in our project because we are using exper outer and this is where we're going to define the screens of our application so this is all about navigation and screens for example index from up folder with index. TSX this is the home screen and if you for example go ahead and change here to button you're going to see that the button text updates automatically now another important part is the components folder where we're going to build our reusable components and for example if I go in index what you will see is the way we are styling our components for example if I'm going to render here a text saying hello world and I'm going to import text from Rec native uh usually we style that with uh objects for example color red and we see it here at the bottom and maybe font size 30 this is the normal way of styling uh using JavaScript objects in react native however we're going to use native wind and Native wind uh gives us the possibility to use Tailwind CSS classes in react native if you have experience with Tailwind it's going to make perfect sense if you haven't work with Tailwind basically uh we are using pre-built class names to style our components for example in R native we're going to do that by passing the class name to our component and here we're going to use some pre-built components for example for color red we're going to do text red 500 and for font size 30 we're going to do text X or free Excel and now we no longer need the objects because we are going to work with this kind of um class names to style our components if we want the text to be in the center we can do text Center and that's going to be in the center if we need some margin we're going to do M four and that's going to add margins on all sides if we only need it horizontally like we can do MX and so on again if you are new to tail wind or native wind the way to find out like what classes you're looking for is to go to tail win css.com and here in the search go ahead and search for something that you need for example border radius how do we do border radius well there is a class name called rounded small medium large and so on or rounded full if I go here and say hey this text I'm going to do background uh purple and I'm not sure if on the text is going to work but let's try rounded full rounded Das full that's going to round the corners of this text so yeah anytime you need some classes go ahead and with the search here try to find what you're looking for like margin you're going to go ahead and see here how the utility classes for margin are working all right now that we know how to work with Tailwind let's go ahead and Define our uh first screen in our application which is going to be the welcome screen again uh as I said I want to start working with this screen that is basically the welcome screen um that we see whenever we open the application and initially as you can see here that's the home screen and right at the beginning we see that the welcome screen is coming from the bottom so that and also another onboarding part I'm going to skip this one but I'm going to focus on this uh welcome screen so we saw that it's not the home screen it's actually a separate screen that comes up um if this is the first time we're using the app so let's go ahead and do here welcome. TSX and do export default function called welcome screen and return here let's say a view with a text that will say welcome to the application let's go ahead and import View and text from RE native and I can style it with some class name Flex one item Center and justify Center to put the text in the middle and instead of background white let's do background a very brown or dark yellow so I'm going to do 950 and for the text I can do yeah class name text white font Bol and a very large text now we're not going to see the screen because exp router by default navigates to the index. TSX file what I will do here for a second um is I'm going to comment out everything here and I'm going to return a redirect component imported from export router so we do import redir from exper router here at the top and we say that whenever we go to the home screen go ahead and redirect right away to the slash welcome the new screen that we've built and just like that we see the welcome message that we've built here let's go ahead and adjust a little bit the settings of this um of this screen in terms of if we have a header and so on this header is coming from the stack navigator that we find in the _ layout so the welcome screen is part of this Tech Navigator if we want to by default it's going to take all the default settings and options if we want to adjust them we can go ahead and expand this TCH navigator to have a opening and then a closing component and then in between we're going to render stack. screen and by using the same name as our file for example in this case welcome in the layout stack. screen name welcome I can use options which are react navigation options so if you have experience with Frack navigation these options are exactly the same so here you can change the title new title and at the top we're going to see new title but in fact what I want here is to actually say header shown false and that's going to completely hide the header and we can also add here a presentation mode I think it's presentation and the presentation can be a full screen model if I'm not mistaken so if I reload hm doesn't work presentation model still doesn't work what if instead here I do welcome what if I manually if I add a link for example somewhere here I'm going to delete everything and I'm going to put a link saying saying uh welcome screen what it doesn't like here here oh I forgot the return statement so if I go ahead and press on this welcome screen in this case it shows from here but why not from there as well hm that's interesting and what I wanted actually from the layout is not model but a full screen Model come on how does it work full screen model and in this case if I press welcome it's going to come from the bottom but it's going to be full screen and by the way this is only going to work on iOS because a full screen model on Android is a little bit different so I know that on Android it's not going to come from the bottom but I don't think that's the most the the biggest issue uh I'm wondering why it's not going doing the same like this here router it's just like that so maybe we we should do it a little bit differently maybe we should do here a use effect so when the component mounts maybe we do router. push welcome and this use effect should come from uh use effect from react and use router from here can I do just router attempt before mounting the component const router use router let's try this way as well but anyway I don't think this is a problem so I'm going to Simply leave this return direct at the top and we're going to focus on the welcome screen we see the welcome screen that's already good we can go here and start working on it uh one way uh for example if we go to up. Json under user interface you can do either automatic or dark if you want the status bar to be visible on a dark uh interface so you can also do automatic here if you support dark and light mode but yeah that's what I wanted okay perfect let me go ahead and um bring in a screenshot that we're going to try to replicate and the screenshot is this one uh so we want to have a title Apple invite here basically at the first half of the screen we're going to have something different like we're going to have this uh component that scroll through different events and on the bottom half we're going to have some text like welcome to Apple invites and some text here and then a button let's go ahead and do that in our welcome screen so we will already have this welcome text I'm going to put it into a view to group it together with the rest of the text that we're going to have there because we're also going to have another text that will say welcome to and here it's going to be not just invites and below is going to be an even larger um text so can I copy it from here will it know no no it doesn't want okay so let's do create bu full invitation for your events anyone can receive invitation anyone can receive invitations and so on okay let's go ahead and give some class names here uh for example because I want the welcome text to be in the center I'm going to well first of all let's make let's give it text white to make sure that it's visible then text Center to put it in the center then text LG to make it larger uh welcome to is very bold so text bold or font bold to make it bold now the same here for the invites we need to put it in the text Center and the same here at the bottom but the one at the bottom if I'm not mistaken is the same as the top one um the not just invite should be text 4XL to make it large and the view that contains them I'm going to give there a Gap four to add some spacings between them and maybe even a ping for to make sure there is putting in that component the text below does shouldn't be bold so this one is not going to be bold and the text from the top and from the bottom as you can see that it's not Pure White so we can either do text gray for example 300 like this or even better I think we need to also work with reducing the opacity of that text because as you can see here like if I zoom in that text takes a little bit of the color color from the background so to achieve the same we're going to do a slash here and if we do slash zero that's going to be zero opacity is going to disappear if I do 100 it's going to be 100 opacity let's try a 50 okay that works better maybe the text shouldn't be gray but even white will it work yeah maybe text white 50 maybe it's not 60 let's do that and here as well and as you can see it's kind of something like this and it's taking the color from the background so if the background is going to be I don't know Green it's going to to to the green is going to be visible a little bit on the text as well all right so let's put another view here at the top that later is going to have the the scrollable Marquee component but for now I'm going to say that the class name here should be I don't know I I could do like height one half of a screen and if I do here BG y to see where it is and let's do also with f is going to be here that's because our top component has this justify Center if I take it out it's going to be from the top I think that's how I want it let's do a gray uh only thing is here BG yellow I just want to see see where these components are so let's do for so this component ends here so let's do it as Flex one to take all the available space and um items Center to put the maybe not item Center but justify Center to put the text and this in the center and at the top here we're going to have these cards but we don't want the cards to be behind the the notch so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a safe area view imported from rack native safe area context and I'm going to wrap it around my components here and a class name Flex one Flex one does it need a flex one the problem is that I don't no longer see this one height full with full is it content container Flex one items Center no BG red okay BG red is good and actually I think it can be instead of this one instead of a top one yeah if I remove that one everything is good now so if I do here ABG 950 yeah it's full screen this one is at the top which is going to be our scrollable and maybe it shouldn't be actually half of a screen should be a little bit more so I'm going to do here manually writing 60% to be more than when half of the screen because that's what I think it is here yeah maybe that the invites the text should be even larger so I'm going to go here with 5xl here instead of large maybe 2 XL what else do you think should be different welcome Apple invit the text here should probably be to excel as well no large is good and the button the button I'm going to use a pressable component because a pressable component is similar to a view but allows us to handle press press events so let's go ahead and import the pressible component from R native pressible and inside the pressible component I'm going to put a text saying create your event is that how they say or create an event that's good let's do reload now we're going to see if we just create an event I'm going to go into the pressable and with a class name I'm going to style it class name let's give it the first of all background white let's then give a ping of six best too much maybe four let's give it um a line item Center or items Center and a rounded full to make it rounded rounded full I don't like that it um expands on the whole um screen so I'm going to use a self Center here to make sure that it doesn't expand on the whole item that's because here somewhere at the top we had we had it but at the same time I want a little bit more spacing horizontally so if I have P4 I will put this as py vertical spacing but for the P PX I'm going to do eight double them the space or even 10 you can do here like this uh the AI automatically added the Styles here so I'll probably take it a little bit slower but I don't think I need to change anything there on the text other than maybe the uh text large yeah that's that's better and maybe on the last text there I'm going to do margin bottom five to push it down a little bit and I will remove this background yellow from here as well so something like that what do you think looks good looks good instead of using um 60% here I can replace it with H3 over five and 3 over five that's 60% yes that's correct thank you very much so yeah there are also this kind of if you have by the way highly recommend if this is the first time using native wind to use the extension called Tailwind tail wind this one because it will give you the intellisense and it's going to save you so much time and help you learn faster because I don't remember all the values I remember how it starts for example H and then I see here all the possible values and there are relative values as well like two over four which is kind of same as one over two weird but uh I was looking at 3 over five yeah perfect thank you Mickey is saying oh it's really life yes it's really live I'm um sometimes I'm too focused on delivering on on building uh in order to provide you a better experience watching it later but from time to time I stop and watch live chat so um help me right if you have suggestions if you have ideas on how I can do them better I'm always looking to to improve so please let me know uh okay so let me go ahead and now that we have like the basic structure here I'm going to do a git add git commit um yeah let's do welcome screen basic UI now the next step is going to be to start adding these kind of images for that we are going to need some images so let's go ahead and together find some some images I'm going to go on pexels.com I think we have pretty good style um images um so let's download some of them I'm going to do this one uh let's do maybe something else maybe not a cake but let's do a party I mean like the the images that Apple used there like they are so nice and if I have time like I would generate them with AI but as I said like this week I'm I was so busy with with building the course that they didn't have time to prepare like the images let's do this one um I need vertical images preferably I know this one might be nice and I need something full of colors because these colors will look very nice behind the blur that we're going to have so what else what else let's do this one free download um I don't know NFL this one I know this one and I think we should be good what kind gender reveal party because we are doing like this kind of invitations so let's find it gender reveal party photo as well we already have a cake I need some colors I don't know something like that has colors okay now that we have these images I'm going to go ahead and import them in our application I'm going to put them in the assets but first i'm going to create here a folder images and let me bring in this newly downloaded images so should be these ones and I'm going to name them one to easier manage them free four 5 six and seven and eight let's go ahead and in the welcome here or maybe not even in the welcome but yeah as we are working with welcome let's do here const m let's define the list of events or yeah events is going to be an array an array of events where events are going to have an ID we're going to have an image which I'm going to import from assets images not event one but just one and that's it for now that's it let's do the same for other events as well so event with ID two and here to let's do three four this is AI recommending me so I don't have any magical powers this is all AI for some reason it stopped recommending the moment I said this is all AI so let's do four maybe maybe for now it's it's enough we're going to see later if we need more uh file does not exist why let's check this f file structure require so from welcome we go one layer up then we go into assets then we go into images and it's not PNG is jpg jpg come on AI now it's time for you to take over but you're slow okay so now that we have this events let's go ahead and render their images on the screen I'm going to do that here and I'm going to do that like this I'm going to first map for our events events. map and for each event what I'm going to do is I'm going to Simply render a a comp container maybe a view come on a view and inside of a view I'm going to Simply render an image I'm starting building this component here that has this images so the image will have a source and the source is going to come from this data event. image event. image this component image should be imported from react native image and for a second I'm also going to I don't think I can um yeah I don't think I can uh do that I can do that in BS code but here no but anyway okay so if I reload what's going to happen now all right we see the images but they are super like very tall what I will do is this view here I'm going to say hey the class name is is take the full height of this comp of your parent component so H full uh but with with I don't know what with uh let's do with 96 which is around 380 pixels and I'm going to do for the image the same but in this case I'm going to say hey height full with full and that's it the thing is that they put on top of each other so what I'm going to do in order to make them scrollable is this list of events for a second I'm going to put them in a scroll view in a scroll view like this I'm going to close the scroll view after them I'm going to make sure to import scroll view from rack native and I'm going to say that this scroll view is horizontal just like that we should have this scroll View at the top perfect I'm going to add some pting to the to the component that has one of these items one of these cards so let's do pting five okay that's good now we no longer need the background color gray CU it's breaks like our stuff um now the whole card or maybe the image itself is going to be rounded LG to have rounded corners but we need way more rounded so 2 XL maybe even 4 XL or five I don't think there is four but five no fre Excel is the largest maybe but that's probably okay okay with and height like we're going to manage that a bit later now we just wanted to see something on the screen and uh to be able to scroll through them okay so it's a good start but definitely not what we need uh definitely not what we need but until we get there until we do animations and so one what stands out in this screenshot and maybe you can see it even better in the video if I bring it here can anyone tell tell me how do you think the background of this screen is like the GL green and like gradient and so on what do you think that is and I'm going to play it so that you can see as what happens there because it's not static like something is happening there let me know how do you think this this is buil oblique what's the oblique hey ja how are you doing while you're writing me like how do you think we can achieve the same background as here let me know in the comments I'm going to answer the question question from Mickey brain VAP is looking good already thank you very much uh is the key not required the key here so yes the key is required whenever we are looping for an array of items and rendering a list of components react us uh expects us to send a key a unique key that identifies that item because that key is used to identify and properly manage this component rendering cycle so yes you are right this is required actually is like not super required because application is still working but it's highly highly recommended to have unique IDs here and you're going to see later where I'm going to explain where it's actually crucial to have it because by understanding what's happening we're going to understand like why in some cases we we cannot live without it so Vladimir is saying based one selected photo it sets it as a background blur view uh and the background blur view does the rest uh it is just the image but blower than bigger yes that's exactly how it uh it happens so in the background it sets the image of the currently visible item here and then it puts a blur on top of it and that's how it achieves this view so let's try to do that ourself at the top let's go ahead and put here and image oh that's why I didn't need yeah I'm going to show you in a second so let's start with an image and for the source I will simply say hey take the image of the first event events at position Z dot image okay but for the class name put it as absolute and now it looks good but maybe it needs that top zero uh bottom zero left zero right zero maybe there is a shortcut for this like absolute feel or something like that I don't know maybe [Music] Absol no if if you know like this one better let me know oh and even if it's in the safe view because it's absolute it actually works really well so absolute means that it's not going to affect anyhow the other items that we display here so now that we have that view behind what we need next is to put on top of it a blur because now the items are not visible they like the image from the background is too visible and um actually is not helping us we're going to use explor blur which is a component a blur view that on Android it's experimental so I'm not sure how well it works on Android if I'm not mistaken it works but in some cases might have some issues on iOS it works pretty well so let's go ahead and install it using npx Expo install Expo blur come on let's open a terminal install Expo blur and if you scroll down to see how it looks how it works is you just wrap it around the components that you want to be everything inside will be visible on top everything behind is going to be blurred with intensity and that's how we're going to do it so what we need to do is we need to wrap everything except our background image in that blur View and this way the image is going to be behind the blur view from Rea na from Expo blur I'm going to put this one at the very end here and I'm going to say intensity 100 just like that uh we see that I imported blur view from X for blur here and just like that we have some blur m I don't like that it doesn't go all the way to the top and all the way to the bottom because we have a safe area above so I'm going to move back to a view here because a view is going to be full screen and I'm going to put the safe area view inside the blur view so I'm going to render a safe area view here inside where we have a content and I'm going to close it before we close the blur View and just like that the content is displayed in a safe A View but the image and the blur is full screen so just like that we have that nice blur View and if we go ahead and change the image from zero to one it changes from to three to five maybe we don't have five but to four what's going on doesn't want events four 1 2 3 four anyway maybe free yeah it's visible two oh yeah because we have four items and it goes from zero to three sorry my bad um one but at the same time another problem that I see is that for images especially the ones that are too light for example maybe this one uh that we see here is too light and in that case again like there is not enough contrast what I will do is I will also render on top of a image a view that is going to serve as um as a overlay so the class name of that view is also going to be absolute with bottom zero and so one to take it the whole screen and the background if I do background black it's going to be black and we no longer see the image but if I do background black with 50% opacity now it's better so let me see if I remove it so if I comment it out it's too the background is too too light if I put it it darkens it a little bit and now the content on top is visible better what do you think how should I play with this to make it even better maybe intensity lower no I think everything was good like with maximum intensity two three one one and so one yeah Francis index at zero definitely thank you very much okay I think now it looks better if you have suggestions on how I can do it maybe we can even darker it by doing 80 here maybe we shouldn't use black maybe we should use a gray I'm not a designer and don't know exactly like what's going going to be the effect of all of this uh so gray actually makes if it's a very light gray it's going to make it more closer to White if it's 800 which is a darker gray it's probably better if it's full black it's the different situation but I think black is kind of good maybe 60 or 70 or 70 is too much maybe I will leave it to 50 perfect I don't know there is way more color here but maybe even it's because of the images right black seems worth here yeah thank you um Now quickly I want to experiment with seeing how I can swap the backgrounds even if I'm not going to finish the the the full like I'm not going to connect it to automatically do that let's imitate the change of the background by pressing on this button so I'm going to have here a state that I will update so active maybe not even active event but active index set active index let's do it at position zero and the state we're going to import it from rect now using this active index I'm going to render it here the image uh and when I press on the button let's do here const on button press I'm going to do set active index to active index + one and I'm going to put this function on this pressable on press on button press so if I press next uh create an event it's going to go to the next image create an event it's going to go to the next image and to see it better I'm going to do blur intensity zero and I'm going to remove this view all together okay now what we see is cannot read property image of find Define because we are always incrementing it but we should check if active index is already the last item if it's more than events. length minus one then we're going to go back to zero otherwise we're going to increment it so now starting from zero next next next I think I know a problem come on why are you if it's more or equal probably right another problem the that image is like way too big but why um contain top left What's Happening Here We full height full and I need only left zero without right zero and top zero without bottom zero so I need to position it in the top right corner and then save it h full and W full and here instead of container I'm going to put cover to cover the whole space and now I think it's better yeah now it's better because previously it was too zoomed in and not sure if this one is the same thing for the absolute what I can do so if I do 60 as you can see it darkens the background and if I do here 100 it has this blur Perfect Image background set the property to adjust the blur amount what do you mean set the property to adjust the blur amount property I'm going to go back to zero and I want to introduce something now when I change the image as you can see it changes instantly like it it's a jump cut it simply replace the image with a different one if we look in this video of how apple is doing as you can focus on the background as you can see it doesn't change instantly it has some kind of Animation it slowly goes from one to another so how would you do that how do you um think a little bit about how would you change the image like in an animated way like going from one to another like with a fade animation not like instantly because it's a small thing but these are why Apple designs are looking so good and I want to show you how we can do that as well so WR in the comments in the live chat uh what do you think how do you think this is accomplished and I'm going to go ahead and show you something so if we go to react native reanimated and you might think yeah we can do like with frag animated like complex stuff but I'm going to show you how easy it is I'm going to scroll down until we see entering exiting animation under layout animations so if I press on this button we see that it has this fade in Fade Out when a component comes into play and goes away and the way it's implemented is super easy all we have to do is import animated from react native reanimated and also import a animation type for example fade in and Fade Out let's import these two animated F fade in Fade Out let's go to the component that we want to animate and in this case is this image that we see here and this image whenever we need to animate a component we need to transform it to animated. image for example nothing is going to change now but if we do here entering and specify that when the component enters where when it is mounted apply a fade in animation and exiting apply a Fade Out animation we're going to reload and we're going to see that nothing really happened why this is where key the key comes into play the thing is that entering and exiting Works based on mounting and unmounting a component and the problem is that this animated image is only mounted once and then we simply replace the source we are using the same component but simply replacing what it display because we never unmounted it we just render it once and then we replace it and it keeps being mounted in the component if we want to force this component to if we want to force react to initialize a new component every time we change the image we need to provide a unique key here and the key let's take it as events dot or maybe yeah it should be in this case active index or even maybe like active index. image like this so now you're going to see that when I move from one to another maybe I can even comment out this blur view oh but we need to have a button and just leave somewhere here with pressable margin top 72 and if I do move you're going to see that the privious image is fading out and the new one is fading in and we can achieve that we can even change the duration to increase it and now it's going to be slower as you can see yeah sometimes it jumps and maybe the images are heavier to load so like you can even optimize this by preloading some of these images uh probably with Expo image that would be better but even now like it's it's a nice going from from one image to another you can see that better if we increase this one and you're going to see that it simply goes from nothing and then comes the next one if I press goes to there and Fades into another one and everything is because of his key and entering and exiting because by having a unique key react says okay this is another key I cannot reuse the same one as previous time I will have to unmount the previous one and mount a new one with a unique key so probably this is going to help you understand better why do we need this key because that's how react understands like can can I reuse the component or should it be recreated from scratch that's how react manages the memory of the components now if I'm going to remove this temporary button and bring back my blur view here everything and increase the intensity to 100 now uh if I press why is it looks like it's not animated right or I know it's animating but it's way too slow so I'm going to do maybe one second is good yeah now now it's much better I'm still not super happy with with this but probably it's about the the actual colors of my of my cards nice because I I think I have more items there so I can do five five how many do we have I think we have what eight six six yes we have eight maybe we have better images there let's do seventh and eight S 7 8 8 reload next next next next yeah I like it yeah this one looks nice 7 it looks like the Apple cards have Shadow yeah indeed they do and I'm going to try to apply this Shadow uh to this wait to V view by saying no no no to V view because this is a card let's try to do Shadow large I'm not going to I'm not sure how it's going to look but let's at least yeah I think it looks nice without Shadow with Shadow and you can do XL XL doesn't look good to XL because uh think it doesn't go beyond this component but large work really well medium SM medium maybe medium yep I'll leave it as medium hello will you write back end um let me know if you're interested in implementing the actual functionality of this application today I want to focus a little bit more on the animations and show you how to build these animations and if we have time by the end to implement more user interface features like the forms and so on uh but if you're interested in seeing how to do the back end and the functionalities maybe we can prepare something um for the next week I'm going to start the poll here um ABD is saying I've never used Styles and class names in re native is it like Tailwind with re native or what it is called yeah this is basically what he said is Tailwind in R native and that's made possible but by a library called native wind so native wind allows us to use Tailwind CSS classes in reck native and if you have experience with Tailwind like this is going to be so much better for you at least for for me like if you for me it works really better anyway let's go ahead and do a get status our applic is already looking better uh blur background just by adding some blurs uh it's already looking better the next step is going to be a bit more challenging but actually before we do the next step I will show you also how we can do other entering and exiting animations because they are super easy to do and it already gives so much it makes your UI look so much better your applications at the beginning as you can see the screen brings the header from top to bottom and then the text as well so let's try to animate this entering animation as well to bring the top part down we're going to have to check what what is the top part the top part is is this view right this is the top part of the screen so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say this is going to be an animated do View and the entering animation of it is going to be I can do it as a fade in I don't need exiting and I will put it after the class name and now if I'm going to reload you're going to see that the whole component fads in but actually what I need is a little bit different I need it to come from top to bottom and you can see in entering and exiting animation what kind of animations we have here where is fade in Fade Out from right to bottom and so one I think apple is just not even fading in it's just simply moving them from top to bottom like or maybe a little bit of fade so moving bounce flip light speed pin wheel roll rotate Slide the slide in up I think slide in up let's trve a slide in up I'm going to import it here slide in up and I'm going to use it here for this view sliding up I will leave a duration original and see how it looks as you can see comes from from the top I think it's good it takes a little bit of time to load the images so like to optimize this screen like you would first preload the images and only then go to the screen to avoid this kind of moment where it loads it's it loads the images but everything else I think looks good but why it stops there you see now it's has and spacing from the safe area view but if I do the slide in up I think it has a bug it doesn't take into consideration the safe area view h that's that's a bug we need to ah don't like it I can do here a Manuel uh margin [Music] top 24 or imagine top 20 and V safe area view I'm going to say only apply to the bottom Edge but this is um this is a quick fix of the slide in up bug not taking safe area ping in consideration or maybe I'm doing something wrong but I'm not adding it here I'm manually adding it here and now I think it it kind of works okay and you can do the same for the text as well because for example the the text welcome to and the one from the bottom they all come from the top to bottom so I'm going to make it anime animated. text and I'm going to say entering is also a how's it called um slide in up and the same thing for the bottom text here uh animated. text animated. text I m. text and the enter ring is going to be sliding like this and if I reload don't like it what's happening there actually the TX himself I think here is going to be fade in up fade in up let's try fading up yeah fading up works much better and the same things goes to this one for the button so let's do animated do pressable hopefully it doesn't have a pressable so animated has like most common components like View image text and so on but it doesn't have all components if you need to transform something to a animated component we can import from rect native animated create animated create animated component and then we can say const animated pressible is going to be equal to create animated component from pressible and now we can use it what uh animated component from what am I missing here r model R native reim has no exported C animated component did you mean no wait a second let me check um create animated component how do I import it create animated component maybe I'm going to do it with animated dot an animated dot without importing it not sure why but this way it works now I'm going to do animated pressible I'm going to replace it with this one because I also want to put here the entering fading up yes let's do reload and now the button as well does fading up but as you can see all of them are at the same time in case of Apple some of them are first for example the top one is first and only then the the items below what we can do is we can do a DOT here and say delay and this is going to delay this animation by 1,000 seconds by 1 second as you can see maybe 1,000 is too much but 300 and same should happen to the text as well this one and this one maybe 100 like I don't know as you can see I know of properties but I don't know how to make it look really good and this one in the center it has a very nice animation like this I'm not going to do that I'm going just to do a fade in so for the text in the middle which is not just invitees let's do it animated. text animated do text and I'm going to do entering a simple fade in maybe it's also going to need a delay I think it's uh way smoother slower for example this one at the top the top part entering sliding up maybe the duration not 1,000 by 5 600 oh one pos and let try and in this case this one will have a one f delay to start when that one finishes and this one a 1,000 delay entering damping 12 let's see if I add damping to which one to to the top part let's try do d damping 12 damping let's see damping um entering exiting and let's do ding spring base fade in Spring ify maybe I can do it spring ify because yeah like probably it's anyway I think this one is already better maybe this should be 800 no no no this one probably 1,000 but the others shouldn't wait for this to fully finish let's try it like this it's okay I think it's good text on the top doesn't move as much as the one on the bottom you're just finding this right values like is a challenge in itself yeah I think this one also needs for example damping 12 and duration 500 or maybe to make it spring ify actually but go ahead and play with these values yourself and see what you can achieve with them because yeah so far so good so someone is saying spring ify D is saying do I need spring if5 before if I do that um why it comes from I need if I do spring ify I don't need need duration I need Mass so Mass 10 stiffness 100 what's going to do who um okay that's that's also something I'm not sure if here they do it as a spring maybe I can yeah but yeah again you can play with it there is one overshoot clamping overshoot clamping true that's not going to go below right yeah I don't like that oh this one is good oh yes look at this starts first slow downs slows down at the end oh boy I think this is really nice let me try the same for others for example for the welcome to what's going to to happen if I do for all of them but I need delays for hours for example dot delay for 500 yeah I'm spending probably way too much time here yeah I think this is much better uh I think the this one fade in doesn't need B Because doesn't have movement it doesn't work something is happening here entering fade in I'm looking at this invite do duration maybe I'm going to do duration 1,000 just to make sure that the text in the center yeah it works 500 okay now it's better all right so I'm going to do a g ad I spent way too much time there but now yeah entering layout animations thank you very much diamond for giving me the hints with spring ifying the animation it definitely looks much better now okay so as I was saying the next part is going to be super interesting because the next part is going to be about implementing the animation of this component the scrolling of the the component on the top because as you can see here in the video that's how it works it automatically Scrolls and we can also scroll ourself so that's what we are going to do next let's go ahead and start this part by creating a component because right now we on the welcome screen we have too many things and we're going to get a little bit confused let's go ahead and create a component Mar TSX and let's do export default function and and what we're going to render here return for now let's render which part I think the scroll view I'm going to leave this animated view because it's part of a welcome screen but the scroll view is going to go from here into our component here we are going to need in this component to import a view a scroll view an image and we need the events and the events probably is going to be let's do for now events like this later we're going to think how can we do it like reusable but for now it's going to be like this now if I go back to the welcome all I have to do is render this marquet element with by sending the events events like this we imported it from components and now we have it here perfect now the next step you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to remove a scroll View and replace it with a normal view that has a class name Flex row and you might ask why would would do that because now we cannot scroll through it um I decided to do it this way because I want to have full control over how the items are moving in our uh component how we are managing the scroll because this component back in our scroll view the problem with a scroll view is that we cannot go back to previous items and if we reach the end we cannot go next what I want to do is I want to have an infinite scrollable component that is going to change and move items around to make it possible to do it infinitely scrollable that's why I'm not going to try to handle it for a scroll view I'm going to implement it myself and I'm going to do that by using here The View with a class name Flex row as I was saying now we cannot scroll but that's okay um the next thing that I'm going going to do is I'm going to extract this component into the Marquee item so let's create it at the top as Marquee item and what it's going to render is going to render this View and this is going to help us understand like what is the container of all the items and what component is responsible for rendering one of its items just like this now everything is still working fine but we can see the whole the logic of the whole scrollable container and here is the logic of one item The Next Step I want to do is um again let me let me say this you can achieve this in so many different ways in the following step I'm going to show you how I thought about it and how I got to this solution and let me know if you if you know a better way so what I will do next is I will actually display the items with absolute position let's render them at left zero I don't know why they disappeared that's interesting m why did we disappear H full w96 what if I do H 96 as well yeah they appear back so it's Bas because of the Age full that means that I have to manage the height here as well so maybe I can do here H full yeah now it's good so I have here left zero what I want to do in fact is I don't want to put all of them actually I'm going to move the left into the style property and say left zero maybe I can do and this key shouldn't be handled here it's handled here at the Marquee so I don't need it at this level anyway we have left zero here but the thing is that I don't want all the items to be positioned zero pixels from the left I want only the first item to be here then the next one to be a little bit to the to the left and so on and in fact let me go ahead and open up some diagramming because we're going to need a lot of that in order to understand how to move things around so let me open some diagramming let's imagine that we have here the phone let's also Imagine give some uh wids for example I'm going to suppose that the wi of our phone is let's say 500 units or pixels or maybe to simplify it we can give it 100 so the width of my phone is 100 units pixels inch I don't know 100 something then we have cards we don't know yet like what the WID of a card is but we have cards of a specific wave and it's going to go here and this one is going to go here this card is going to be card number one this one is card number two and this one is card number three okay let's um go ahead and give these cards a very specific wh for example maybe for the sake of Simplicity I'll do it 50 pixels and let's say that they are like this close together there is no gap between them so I will make them 50 pixels like this okay um just because we say we have a specific wave of items let's give it here so let's do uh const item width is going to be equal to 50 do I need it here or maybe I let's let's do it at the top first and then we're going to figure out how to do it like more dynamically so item with is 50 I'm actually going to say that the width of this view is item with and I'm not going to give it 96 here 50 is too little so I'm going to bump it up to 500 300 something like that maybe 250 to be half of a screen similar to our diagram so if you want closer values not to get confused our screen size let's assume it's 50 and the size of one of these items is 250 250 250 so if I say that the item should be position left zero that means zero pixels from the left part from from this side of our screen so this side that's good for the first item but the second item should be at position 250 because that's the size of this item the thir item should be 250 plus 250 so in fact the left or the let's do con initial position should be equal to the item with multiplied by the index of the item index of item the index of item we're going to send it through properties because from the item inside we don't know which is the index but from the outside when we for them we will know the index and we can send it through properties to our item now we take initial position and say that the left is equal to initial position let's reload and now we should see this and we see spacing between them because we have pting on this View and IM the image is actually smaller than the whole component I'm going to remove this one and you're going to see that the images touch each or to better think about it we can do background uh purple 700 and let's do it as 20% or 50% so now you see that actually as we have in this diagram they the items themselves are close together and they are positioned correctly right well right what's the next step the next step is to handle the scrolling let me think like what's going to be easier to to show you the automated scrolling or the manual scrolling I think it's going to be the automated scrolling for the automated scrolling scrolling itself is going to be an animation and the animations in R native animated usually are powered by a shared value a shared value is a value that uh can be used on both JavaScript side but it actually lives on the UI side meaning that changes to that variable are going to be applied instantly to the UI when it's used on the UI it doesn't go from JavaScript it doesn't have to go from JavaScript Fred to the UI Fred because it already lives on the UI Fred so our value that we're going to power our scrolling is called scroll value and let's define it as use shared value and let's start with zero use Share value is a hook that we have to import from from reanimated RE native reanimated perfect now with scroll value let's go ahead and first send it to the Marquee item as scroll I'm going to go back and see that hey we are going to receive a scroll and as you can see types um the AI is suggesting us that scroll is going to be a Share value of type number that's good I'm going to import a type shared value from reanimated everything good maybe I can extract the properties into a separate type here it will be easier to read them you don't have to type it properly because the point we we are focused a little bit on the animations but anyway like you can you can follow this type as well and write it yourself uh maybe I don't need the background purple anymore but we have this scroll position what we're going to do with this scroll position well we are going to influence the value of this left so we are going to add the scroll position to the initial position this way as we scroll through the items we move how far left like the the position of the item we can do that by using let's do uh animated style and we can define a the animated style using a a hook called use animated style and the value that we're going to return here is going to be a style is going to be an object that will listen to this shared values SC scroll and whenever we update the scroll it's going to update the style and that's how we apply animated Styles the animated sty that we want to apply now that depends on the on a shared value is called scroll that we need to apply to left so left is going to be the initial position of our item plus scroll. value now this animated style should be applied to this View and to animate a view view it should become an animated do view animated. view animated should be imported from reanimated like this animated and if we for the Styles here if we go ahead and apply uh put them into an array we can have static Styles and also together or besides the animated style that we defined here we no longer need to apply the left here because this is already an animated style and the weave can be like this it's okay I'll reload my application and nothing happens but if I go to the use Share value here and say move it to 10 pixels or 100 pixels you're going to see what happens it's going to be moved one pixels to the right if I do move it to 200 pixels you're going to see moved even more or minus 200 pixels is going to go the other way okay this is how I manually did that but what I can do is I can start this um automated animation which can be started in a use effect with with timing but what I'm going to do is in fact I'm going to use a compo uh hook called uh how is it use any M frame frame something like that use frame callback use frame callback is a hook that lets us run a function on every frame update so if our application is of has a frame rate of 60 Seconds of 60 frames per second that means that we can run a function 60 times every second and we can apply real time animations like this so that's what I'm going to do in this component I'm going to manage the scroll inside this use frame callback and I'm going to say hey this Frame callback comes from reanimated as well and I'm going to say hey scroll value should be equal to scroll. Value + one what do you think is going to happen in this case and it doesn't have this um dependency array it's just a function in this case like every frame rate we're going to move items one pixels to the right and it should start at zero um what I want to do is I want this scroll to actually move up like from zero to 1 2 3 4 and so on but I want the items to uh move in the direction so I'm going the Marquee item in the animated style I'm going to say initial position minus scroll value and this way is going to move there so as you can see it's already working hello mobin and the way it works is this function that we added to the use frame callback is being called on any on every frame on every frame so it's being called 60 times a second on average and what we do like on every frame we move a scroll one pixel we move a scroll like yeah one pixel and then we move all the items when we render to the left this is working but let me show you a an actually a little bit better way of doing that what I mean is by using a let's do um um scroll speed is equal to one by having a value here we can apply it like this scroll value scroll speed and then we can change the scroll speed to 10 and it's going to move faster so we have influence on how fast we move I'm going to leave it to one for a second this is fine but it's not exactly right because as I was saying this function is called approximately 60 times a second uh but let's imagine that we have a phone that has a refresh rate of 120 which which means that this function is going to be executed twice as often as on a normal on another device which means that on a device with a higher refresh rate our scroll speed is going to be higher because we are going to call this function two times more or on a device with 30 frames per second this animation is going to run two times as slow which we don't want we actually want the same speed on every device and to achieve that the frame callback has frame info here if you go ahead and do console log frame info and look into this here you're going to see let me stop somewhere a couple of properties times since the first frame times since previous frame which is 16.6 on average and this 16.6 on average if you go ahead and do the math and divide where is it not now if you divide 1,000 by 60 frames per second you get this 16.6 which is where it's coming from but as you can see it's not always exact same number because some frames can take longer some frames can take slower depending on how busy is the CPU of a phone that means that we can we should take the time since not for frame by time since previous frame and based on that amount update or apply to the to the to the movement what I'm going to do is I'm going to say const I'm going to calculate the Delta time or Delta seconds and I'm going to take this time since previous frame and divide it by 1,000 because there it's milliseconds I'm going to divide it by 1,000 and also make sure that we put this one in a like this because during the first frame this is going to be null so we will put zero if it's the first frame now having the Delta seconds uh we can apply it to this speed we can multiply it by speed because what we want is to move one pixels pixels per second and this Delta time says what um percentage of a second was this Frame and then we M multiply the speed with that Delta seconds and we get the amount of pixels we want to move in that direction and usually we want like more than one pixels per second we probably want like I don't know per second like I don't know at least 50 pixels and if I reload now it's going to work you might think that it's the same but actually this is this is the correct way of doing this it's going to run with the same speed on different devices is going to run with the same speed with when the phone like um varies in uh in um in how busy is the CPU and how fast it refreshes the frames so this is a concept that we use very often in game development and when I'm using it I remember how I was think how I was building like games I know seven or eight years ago I was was actually a game developer and this um Delta like was was a very important part for applying modifications on on how you want to move smoothly things okay so now we have this animation of moving items Works nice but has a problem it's stops at one point oh thank you MD Adan is saying how could you make a tutorial of building a fitness application using react native and Firebase authentication uh I would be happy to do that not sure if I would do with Firebase I'll probably do it with like I don't know cleric authentication or super base or something like that like a more modern solution open source um but I encourage you to go to github.com not just Dev SL not just Dev if I'm not mistaken we should have a link in the description and go to the discussions and this is where people submit suggestions and others are voting for what application you want to see so go ahead and open um open a discussion here or vote for the others that you want us to build i' would be very happy to look at the ideas that you guys suggest and um suggest your ideas here okay okie dokie again um our automated scrolling Works nicely now but the problem is is that once the items are off the screen that's it we no longer see anything else and before I actually go ahead and implement the way we're going to manage and move items around um let me first integrate with gestures so that we can also scroll using gestures here not only using uh automation because it's going to help us a lot understand better like how things move and uh is going to help us yeah understand how things are moving so as I was saying on Apple here this items are moving automatically but we can also swipe through ourself that's really cool and that's not super hard to implement for that we're going to use the gesture Handler re native gesture Handler together with reanimated so gesture Handler is a way to handle gestures such as as tapping panning long pressing rotating pinching flinging hovering and so on the gesture that we're looking for is this pan dot gesture because it allows us to track the movement like we press on something and then we move it and that's the gesture that we want here we're going to press on this on the screen and we're going to move and we want the items to scroll and follow the movement of our fingers to do that uh let me let me show you what we're going to have to do from ranimated which we have already installed in package.json I mean gesture Handler we have it already here if you don't have gesture Handler go ahead and follow the installation guide here in the documentation but because we already have it we're going to go here and import two things gesture re native gesture Handler the gesture detector which is a component with detect gestures and the gesture itself that is going to allow us to build the gesture let's go ahead and our Marque component and start by defining our uh gesture is going to be equal to gesture do pen this is the name of a gesture then using uh by changing some methods here we can apply functionalities to these gestures one of the functionality is on uh on begin and I'm going to do here a console console log on begin then we have um another one like chaining it after this one there is on change we're going to console log on change it also has v event and then there is the on finalize event let's oh come on let's do console log on finalize now we're going to have to use this gesture and apply it somewhere here what I'm going to do is I'm going to wrap my whole component in a gesture detector and I'm going to send there the gesture that we just created here okay like this I'm going to end it at the bottom so one so where you render it on the screen is the area that is going to be be you used to detect these gestures so in our case we put it on the whole component Marquee component so that whole area is going to be uh managed by this gesture so now if I look here we see that the gesture detector must be a descendant of gesture Handler root View and even though this component is installed it's not F finished uh configuring because to make just detector work we need to at at a root level come on uh command B at a root level which is our upcore layout we need to wrap it in a gesture Handler root view like this the gesture Handler root view should be imported from react native gesture Handler and make sure to add a flex one here in order to make sure that it's expanding on the whole screen now everything works back in our Marquee here let's open the terminal and see the console logs I'm going to clear the consoles and here if I press on this items what do we see we see one begin then we see on change on change on change on change and then on finalize so this is the whole life cycle of our gesture in fact there are more life cycle methods of a gesture I'm going to explain the difference between two uh the pan gesture if we scroll down come on where is it it's not documented here on start [Music] on no probably it's in the about gure handlers common Handler come on I want to show you gesture State and events most probably okay here it is events on begin this function is called when a gesture doesn't explain super well but basically the on begin is called as the first function when the gesture just starts but it's not yet determined if it's going to be the gesture that we want for example a pen gesture implies pressing moving the finger and then releasing that's a a pen gesture so if we just press and don't move a finger it's going to stop here if we press and start moving it's going to do on start so here on start then as we move it's going to call on change and then there is also on update and at the end it's first going to call on end if the gesture was detected and started but if not it's going to call I mean in any case it's going to call on finalize so on begin is first last on finalize on start second then on end if only this one started and I'm going to show you the difference if I just press and release we see on begin and on finalize the gesture be began but it didn't start it was not detected if I press and move we see on begin on start update change update change because we are kind of the same and at the end we see on end and on finalize on end is only called if on start has been called so that's important to understand because it's the same for everything else and in our case what I'm going to say is hey first of all I'm going to transform our speed from a value to a shared value because I'm going to uh update it because it's a Shar value when I use it I need to use it as value and in the gesture when we begin this gesture I will say scroll speed. value equal Z I'll basically stop the automated scroll so if I press I stop the scrolling now at the end on finalize I'm going to restart automated scrolling scroll speed. value equal to 50 I will remove on start and on end or maybe I should do that in the on start and on end yeah let me do this on start and on end because if I just press where the screen without actually doing the gesture maybe I don't need to stop this so now it goes automatically if I press nothing happens but no that's the problem if I press it should stop automatically cuz now it stops when I start dragging so that's why I'm going to go to on start with on finalize as you can see move these two kind of methods start finalize and begin wait a second I'm already lost I man on begin on finalize they work together so when I change one usually that means that you want to change W as well so now if I just simply press it stops if I release it starts again press it stops release starts again now the next step is like when I move the finger on the screen I want to move that scroll position that's not super hard to do because we have this either on update or on change update is called when things are updated on change is also called van but it also has an additional property called change X which has only the difference in the position from the previous time the on change has been called that's good because we can apply it to the scroll value so we can take scroll value and add the change X to our scroll value if I go back and start scrolling as you can see something is moving but it's in V Direction so probably I should do here minus now if I reload if I start moving it follows exactly my movement if I release it continues automatically cool perfect so that's simple but now let me finalize it with a little touch that is going to make it so much better and this is usually called momentum scroll when we move the finger fast and release it we want items to move very fast if we just slowly move and release it we want them to continue to continue the velocity of our scroll right so to do that on finalize here if we look at the event uh the event is going to have the Velocity X which if I scroll slow and release the velocity is going to be small value like 95 if I do the same but release it fast it's going to be minus 3,000 so we can take this value and we can apply to the speed we can apply it simply like this event velocity apply it here so if I slowly release it maybe it should be minus so if I slowly release it it continues the same movement if I do it fast it continues the same move movement the thing is that I want to the speed to start that high but then to go back to this 50 then SC slow down I can do that by using scroll value uh wave timing uh animation modifier and I'm going to move towards the value 50 but over time not instantly so now if I scroll fast doesn't work oh because it's not scroll but scroll speed scroll speed. value this and I think I will do that over longer duration and when if you look at the reanimated website at the with timing with timing we're going to see the different easing methods so the different um the different functions that are applied to this animation a very usual one would be a linear animation linear and it will look like this so if we go from 0 to 100 it's going to linearly go from 0 to 100 and it looks like this very linear with the same speed all over there is the the most common one probably is in and out which starts slow then picks up the speed and then Ends Slow in our case what I want is I want to start fast and then reduce it at the end and I think it's called just out it starts fast and then reduces it at the end so I'm going to copy it from here and apply it to the configuration of our wave timing wave timing let's do eing and this eing should be imported from react native r at it like this so now if I scroll and release it looks really nice and you should definitely try to build it yourself and and get it on your physical device and see how it how it works where is my items I was not seeing them but now I see nice so we have automated scrolling we have a manual scrolling as well we are doing really good progress uh let me clean up a little bit here things that we no longer need but I think we are good let me go ahead and do a get ad get commit minus M and do it yourself scroll view with auto scrolling and gesture based scrolling perfect the last step is to make sure that our scroll view is infinite and items repeat after we after we scroll them all right I see that 92% of you guys want me to build the back end of this application as well because I'm going too deep into animations but yeah this this app would be really cool to to build it like full stack with back as well because in that case I believe like it can be used in a lot of events like applications all right um Ed favor on Twitter is asking where can I watch a the replay later on you can watch it on our YouTube channel go ahead and search for not just dodev and where you'll find them this one the the replay all right guys so the challenging part starts the challenging part starts well how do we explain this properly all right let's do it like this not exactly sure how but I'm going to try [Music] let me do it like this one two three let's do four as well four as well and maybe I should also do a group like this group selection okay and I can move them like this all right guys so how everything works we have uh I'm going to write here scroll is equal to zero if scroll is equal to zero we have this situation if scroll is equal to to 250 we have the following situation like all V move 250 to the left okay and if scroll is equal to 750 that means that all items move one two and three items to the left so in this situation we already see the problem is that the items are two to the left and we don't not see anything here at the beginning and if the scroll increases more and more more and more the items are going to go farther and farther from the device and we're not going to see them at all the thing is that we are not going to do anything about the scroll um position the scroll is going to be a value that can go to maximum integer value and minimum so it can go to 1 15, 235 and in that case like you can think like these items are very very far that way but what we need to do is we need to take any value that the scroll view here has and understand like where we should place it here on the screen the way we're going to do that let's go back to 750 is that for example when the scroll is 750 what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the first item and I'm going to move it all the way here maybe in fact the second item as well I'm going to move it here so how does this movement going to work well let's go ahead and first Define what is going to be the full with of our uh items so our items um container with is going to be equal to in this case is 1,000 right but it can be calculated by multiplying the number of items with the amount of items now we know that it's 1,000 these are just values now let's draw a box of 1,000 W for example like this and this is going to be red this is going to be our bounds and I'm going to actually do it 1,000 with like this and let's place it not here but let's place it centered to the phone device like this that means that we have 50 pixels here we have 50 pixels left which means that this part is 250 and this part is 250 now this red box is going to be the the box that is going to Define when do we move stuff around meaning as we scroll as the scroll indices go go go go go and as the element number one goes outside the red box we're going to know that we have to take the element and move it all the way here and then we continue we continue moving we move move move as we come here two goes outside the red box we go here okay how are we going to do that well that is going to happen on VAP Marky item because every item is going to handle their left position I [Laughter] individually so first of all we need to know the size of this container the container with the container with we can calculate in the whole con array because here we know how many items we have so let's do uh container width equal to events do length multiply by item with so the amount of items multiply their with let's take this container with and give them to our items they are container with equal to container with let's go ahead and receive the container with as a number here and now knowing the container with we can say hey uh I'm going to add here const uh left position or just left or just let's do position equal to initial position minus scroll value and this position is going to go here the problem with this uh Thing by taking initial position which can be let's consider for the let's look at the first item the initial position is zero so0 minus scroll value that means that this value can be a very large value because I'm going to take the same box in other situations as well and we're going to see how how it works for example in the case of scroll is 750 our or maybe even like more I'm going to do one even bigger example for us to understand like how it looks if it's 1,250 1,250 so it's going to be like this which means that all the items are outside our window our red window so in this case the first item is going to get the initial position of minus 1,250 but if we go ahead and take this value and then we uh take them we divide it by the container with and take the remainder of it that means that we take the2 1,250 we divide it by container with 1,000 but we take only their remainder and the remainder is going to be 250 and 250 means that the one is moving to this position in this situation so by simply doing this remainder we create a bound we create a limit of where the items cannot go past and if they go past they come back to the previous position and as you can see they come back here not exactly where we want but we come back there the problem is that now how we do it divided by container with our window if I'm not mistaken I think the window is like this yes because this is the container with this window is 1,000 pixels and normally it would be here with green but we reverse it we do minus scroll view to move it in the other direction so but from here from a normal position it goes all the way here so that's why when our items go away from here in fact when they reach this position when their beginning goes outside the bound that means that they come back here so that's why we see the following result it kind of works but it comes back to the middle of the screen not to the middle of the screen but to the beginning of the screen here if that makes sense what we have to do is to move this window from here back to where we want it all the way here and to do that what we are going to have to check we are going to have to calculate this shift because initially this position is here we need to move it a bit to to center it in this container to center it in this container we need to take the whole container with 1,000 take out the screen WID 500 and then divide it by two because we have a bit to the left and a bit to the right so this is the amount of shift that we're going to have to do the 250 that you see here to get to this 250 again we take the container WID we uh subtract the width of our screen and then we divide it by two to see how much is to the left and how much is to the right of the red container so let's go ahead and take this one uh const shift equal to container WID so container WID minus the WID of a screen screen with uh divided by two because we need to take we this way we know how much is outside the screen knowing the container with minus screen with we know how much is outside the screen divided by two we can know how much should go to the left and how much should go to the right screen WID can be taken easily using use window Dimension that comes from R native so screen weave now this shift uh we are going to apply where I think what I'm going to do is the initial position I'm going to add the shift what happens if I add the shift and I'm going to comment out the automated animation just for me to see what I want to do is I want to start from the from the [Music] middle initial position if I add the shift and here I need I think I need to subtract it so it start from starts from the middle and I can scroll and I think it never ends oh no it ends it should be other way around here minus shift and here plus shift yeah now it works now it works uh I'm wondering if I'm going to save say that the item WID is 30 pixels maybe 50 and maybe it's not going to have that much poding P1 and maybe I just want to see how everything works I'm going to go here and I'm going to say I only have four items not more as we had in our diagram four items will this work I don't know as you can see it comes here but I'm not sure how to properly displayed to you 50 to maybe here I will do Flex row origin X Auto yeah I think here and if I do here border to border red no doesn't really want height but anyway and why are there only three yeah there are three if I will add the fourth one this is what happens this is the center [Music] and yeah this is the center um I'm not going to be able to show you like because a lot of values has to change like the the screen wave should change and so on so I'm going to go back and hope that everything works how should I show you hello daniil how are you doing even now with only four elements we see see that it's working pretty well we see that it adds it here at the end but it works so with more than four items it's even better because this red box is larger it depends on how many items we have perfect love it and now I can go back and item with I can increase it to maybe not 250 but I'm going to put it inside here and say that the item WID is going to be it's going to depend on the screen WID so I will do screen WID multiply by 0.6 for 60% of a screen WID and if I reload I will go ahead and send the item with to our item as well item with let's receive it for properties and is it 60% maybe six uh putting six is too much here pting two pting three yeah that's good I don't know 70% how are we doing here when it's in the center yeah maybe 65 will be good perfect amazing uh and this was probably the hardest part gate status gate at gate commit - M um infinite scroll I will go ahead and Implement one more thing as you can see the items are moving a little bit in a circular motion they are not linear like the item here on the left it's rotated to the left and on the right it's rotated to the right and one in Middle is the one who is uh just straight so to do that we're going to go back here in the animated style and we're going to say hey let's go ahead and apply a transform and using a transform we can do a rotate Z I think on the z-axis of 10° if I do that we see that all of them are rotated uh if I do minus 10° they are going to be rotated like this so what do we need to do whenever the item the position is closer to the left side of the screen it should be minus 10 when it's in the middle it should be 10 when it's on the right it should be+ 10 for example for that we use an interpolate function an interpolate function can map a value from one range to another one so the range that we want to map is the position or the value of is the position and there are going to be first range and the second range first range specifies what's the range that the position value can be in so let's say that when it's zero the position means that it's right at the left side of the screen and when it's on the other side of the screen we can say that it's with maybe not with but screen with now this is the values of a position and in the second one we need to apply what rotation do we want to apply well we want to apply when it's zero we want to apply minus 10 and when it's screen with when it's on the other side we need to apply 10 the problem is that this should be let's do const rotation equal to this rotation and the thing is that the rotate as you saw should be 10 decrease so this 10 I will replace it with a variable rotation but I need to do it with the degree at the end that's why my application crashed now come on where is expoo reload or install theme and font I know material darker I think it's called my theme okay so something is happening as you can see items are animated but not exactly how we want it well when we get on the this side of the screen on the left if we look here we didn't have a rotation correct rotation but when we in the middle we're supposed to have zero rotation and only when we are on this side of the screen we should have 10 well the problem is that we say screen with here so we say in a way like if I'm going to take this one here come on so when it's zero we wanted this rotation but when it's scen with which we expected it to be here but in fact it was all the way here it was the other way so that's why we have a problem we shouldn't take screen with we should take screen with minus the wi of the item screen with minus the wh of item because it should be here not sure if it makes makes a lot of sense but here screen with minus item with should fix this in the center it's zero on the right it's rotated there on the left it's rotated to the left on the right it's rotated right of course there is a lot of rotation so what I'm going to do is I'm going do rotation maybe 3° even Veer it's a lot and also usually rotations are happening like if I do 45 here rotations are being done based on the center of the element if you want the rotation to be done based on a different point of the element you can do that with a property on the animation view here you can say uh origin transform origin bottom and now the rotation are going to be based on the bottom looks a bit crazy I don't know what's happening there they see me rolling heading yeah I think that's I don't know where is the bottom of that anim ated view because height full if I do here BG red where is the so so it should be on this bottom if position zero minus 10 if position is screen wave minus item wave 10 if I do still a lot even one de is a lot right or it's better and we can also move them down right as they rotate we can move them a little bit down because they go this corner goes too much to the top and looks bigger than the previous one here they kind of rotate in a big circle what I can do is I can do here another transformation because I can do here translate y 10 for example or 100 this will move them down but I want to move them down as interpolating the same position when it's zero I want to move it minus 10 when it's on our hand like it can be 10 but it doesn't make a lot of sense I'm going to show you in a second let's apply it uh when it's zero it's minus 10 No it should be 10 and in this case minus 10 we're coming from top to bottom so actually I want both left and right to be below so I will do 10 and 10 there the problem is that now all of them are to the bottom we need a value when it has zero translation so we need a third value here and the third value is going to be the center point what's the center point well if this is that part I guess it's divided by two if this is this the the right side screen wave minus item wi divided by two or simply no but I think it's it's correct screen with my item with divided by two so here it's zero yeah we see that left and right are at the same positions maybe they need a little bit more rotation and a bit a bit less um displacement like maybe three pixels it's too much man uh one yeah they to be honest like the way they did it I understand how it works I don't know how to build it correctly basically the items they all rotate around the same Center somewhere at the bottom of the screen like in my case I am faking it and you can see it like if you if you look good like you can see that this rotation is not perfect but I think it looks really nice I know 1.5 can you do that yeah what's different like when you see this one yeah for me it's too much rotation so it should be one a bit less spacing uh ping two a different aspect [Music] ratio maybe for the height in the welcome maybe it should be 5050 where I have it free uh one half of the screen origin bottom may need the numeric value why do you think so I know that origin bottom can be numeric as well but bottom itself should work the problem is that if I was thinking about doing like a pixel but it's going to move together with animated value but it should be somewhere here like so it shouldn't move or it should be replaced back I don't know it's interesting but yeah I think this works nicely good let's me do let let me do get add get commit minus M um rotations rotation I don't have where is the button and I think the last step on this screen on this animation screen is to change the background of the screen with the picture that is being highlighted in the scroll view here for that to happen in the whole Market list we need to from knowing the scroll position we need to understand which item is currently visible uh that's why I'm going to use a use animated reaction and this is similar to a use effect but it works on animation value on shared values and it can react to something happening on a shared value the way it work is first we're going to return the scroll. value in the first function and in the second function let me import the use animated reaction here and in the second function we're going to get the value of that scroll and I can do console log scroll or value value [Music] uh so prepare react and dependencies dependency I don't need the scroll value is dependency I don't think I need it so let me check here yes we have the scroll view here press scroll now to understand which item is currently visible we need to first of all in a similar way as we did here for the position we divided it by the container withd we need to do the same here to make sure that we bound the scroll value for example const normalized scroll equal to Value uh and the remainder from the division with container with now that is going to go to these values and when it's going to go too much too high it's going to come back from zero hopefully let me help it okay as you saw here it goes from a large value back to to normal now knowing the normalized value I can take const um active index is equal to uh I think it's this one normalized scroll divided by item with and then we just take the flo the floor value we so if I reload this is zero that means that says that the current visible item is zero if I keep scrolling slowly as I will as the second item comes closer to the left or actually when it goes starts going be behind the left it moves to one so it works well but it should trigger this when the item comes somewhere in this in the center of a screen not when it comes to the left of the screen so what we need to do here is normalized scroll should I do minus half of the screen minus half of a screen no I think it's minus half my it's it's it's it's this one where is it minus screen WID minus item WID divided by two we think it it considers when it goes be behind this line it considers the active what we need to do is we don't need to move it in the middle of a screen because in that case this is going to be considered the active line it should be moved when this the center of item is in the middle of a screen when the center of item is in the middle of a screen which means that this line will move here which is half of a screen minus half of the item or screen with minus item with divided by two that's how I understand that's probably why we needed it here and and this is going to go into the normalized scroll I guess minus or plus I don't know we're going to check reload this is minus one then it should be plus uh normalize scroll plus this one reload this is zero and as soon as the second item crosses the center it should say one the center of the second item somewhere here one as you can see here it's zero here it's one here it's zero here it's one but yeah yeah I think I think that's good maybe maybe even it should be should be faster I would say maybe even here it should start which means that the left of the item crosses the half of a screen which can be accomplished by plus half of a screen without item WID so if the left crosses half of a screen WID 0 0 0 and as we cross here it's already one if we go back it's zero yeah I think this one is a little bit better like which one is more on the screen here is zero here it's one zero one yeah I'll leave it like this and what we need to do with this active index we need to Let's uh store it in a state I guess const state or yeah active index and what we want to do is set active index with this active index the thing is that this is going to throw an error because animated reaction is a worklet it runs on the UI UI fret the state is available only on the JavaScript Fred so we're trying to call a JavaScript function from a UI Fred this is not possible and it crashes the application but to solve it we can call a function run on GS and then as the second parameter no we give it here and the parameters in the second set of brackets so we say run on GS this function and when you run it give them this value let's try to see if it will work and now because that that is a state we can even render it here as active index I'm not sure where where it's going to be displayed but I can do that R native let's do text it's very there zero one and so one I will do some class name text white I'm not sure if you see it but it's it's there and it actually works it updates whenever the index changes but what we actually need is not to render it on the screen we need it in the welcome screen to know what background image to show we have here active index what we're going to do is we're going to send a call back function to our Market saying on index change when the our component will decide with the index changes is going to call this function and this function is going to call the set active index so I can go into market and say hey we're going to also receive here on index change which is a function that should receive a num send the number back and we're going to do it here let's do it through a use effect use effect when the index active index changes we are going to call this function and actually it can be optional and we can do here if on index change do that oh look at that I can already see the images changing and I'm going to go here and set blur to zero and we're going to see how they change boom I think they change like at the right moment when the second image comes here and if I scroll manually it's also going to change cannot read property image of undefined H that's interesting that means that the index is larger than the number of items active index normalized scroll maybe I should add it here you know the screen with in the in this value not here this one I mean and I think it should be plus okay does it change on when it has to yeah it still Chang changes when it has to but hopefully if I go very right yeah now it's working much better it doesn't go uh in a place where the index is not is outside the array nice I love it perfect let me go ahead and go back here to what we had 17 and this one looks so nice let me do a Reload boom why it's not changing oh I forgot this one perfect I'm so happy with how this animation turned out what do you think guys uh what do you think about the complexity like is it super complex super confusing or did I manage to to make it clear this was update the active index get commit update the active index let me do a poll let me know what do you think about the the animation so far I'm I'm wondering and and be be straightforward like if this is still hard if it's if it's confusing let me know I think like how to to better uh maybe to a to cover like easier and simpler animations uh but I really had fun like implementing this one it was challenging but it's it looks nice and this is side by side with this one another thing that I'm wondering how to how it can be achieved is as you can see at the bottom of these cards there are there is content there not card but there is a blur view which is a gradient blur view so that's interesting like I don't know how I would do it a gradient blur View what we can do is we can even change how do we display stuff here um like if you want you can make this component super reusable similar to how a flat list works we can specify here the not events but data and then a function render item maybe like this is a little bit more uh complex but if you want as I said if you want to make this component reusable and insert anything there first of all I'm going to change here from events to items back in Mark here let's work with um items items items where else here items let's do item and do item. ID let's do with a question mark item and here not event but items so in this case we we try to work with very generic components like item and so on back in the Marquee item here we're not going to receive a event button item item and here we're going to do item. image good back in the welcome screen what we actually want to do is we want to um the the Marky item here does all the animations and stuff on the animated view but inside like what we render should actually be something I'm going to copy something that the component itself should not care about it should come from the outside so what it should be is similar to how we have in a flat list render item we should have a function that will give us the item and we should render this image for example now let's go ahead and implement this render item on the Marky component here as render item like this and it's going to send back not like this the item but it's going to send back the item and the index as item any index number okay now having this render item we're going to send it down to the Marquee item itself equal render item and at the top here instead of the image we can say hey call the render item and send and send there the item that you're working with maybe not even here maybe at this layer we can work with children look here I'm going to work with the children and children can can be implemented here as props with children this is the type okay where is it and the props with children will be imported from react this is a little bit more advanced so if you're confused you don't have to do it keep what is working this is just to make this component reusable now item we can we will receive a children component that we have to render and we are going to render them here inside our animated view now it's only thing that to from the Marquee component when we Loop Pro them is to actually render the children meaning that we have to open this component and call here the render item like this not there which means that we don't even need to send the item to the Marquee item uh because we render it here and send it as children back in the mar item here actually I'm going to remove item an item because we are not needed and I think it should work because we specify what we want to render inside those components inside those items from the place where we are using the component and it's back to to working which means that now we don't have to look at all this code because this code is like quite challenging like low level and so on but it's done simply to to do the this animation when we have to work with actual cards that we want to display in this component we don't have to mess around with all of this we active index and so on we can work on the higher level for example we can add here A View and we can add the image and then we can add a text saying B birthday party and then this image can be uh absolute uh um this view class name is also going to be H full with full now this birthday party is going to be text white and it's going to be let's do here um items bottom or items end no item Center and justify and I'm not sure if you can see it but I'm going to do here a footer component with birthday party it says height one no height should be I don't know um 24 it can be I don't need this item Center here [Music] I will do let me check how it's done here which party so I will do something like text to XEL text Center and here justif y center something like that and maybe this view is actually going to be a blur view with intensity of 50 or 20 or one or 10 okay that's good uh I'm not sure if this background color works here no it doesn't absolute don't need the absolute no no no it's normally positioned and maybe what I will do is I will do instead of background instead of here A A View that will be class name full full like this and absolute this is going to add this dark effect so instead of doing this normal view maybe I'm going to add a linear gradient so there is Expo linear gradient that we can install like this and we're going to use it like this you can use image background component yeah I think I can use image background as well but what's going to be the benefit compared to an absolute image another thing I see now is that um the image has rounded but in fact I want this component to be rounded like this one not the image itself and if I add overflow hidden it should hide the the Overflow now it's better now back to my linear gradient experiment that I want you to try if I go ahead here an import linear gradient and change where is it this view to a linear gradient like this I will re comment out this View and it's going to be let's do Styles shet where is styleset dot look if I import Styles shet there is an absolute F helper that will do absolute and will F the whole view so if I have zero here that's going to be something like that if I do red here okay the bottom is red I need other way around I need this one here and transparent on the top like that maybe here like even one no one no eight and maybe not like transparent or I would need another option here like I don't know six or something like that if I do four it doesn't make sense because that's normal but I wanted more at the bottom and a bit less to the top I think that's what I was looking for and if I do back to 20 intensity it's better it's not exactly what they have here because as I look here we have a linear gradient blur view but in my helps I don't know if it helps but yeah it help it definitely helps okay okay so this is what we have now but the cool thing is that as you can see we are handling this at this layer and what we can actually do is we can say that this becomes its own component called uh if event card. TSX which is going to be export default event card and what we're going to render is this View From Here we need to import a lot of stuff here import view Tex stle blur view linear gradient and we're going to receive here event of type probably any uh so we're going to replace item with event because in this case we're working with an event so it's good to be specific not item because it's an event card um and back in the welcome here in the render item we can say event card that we are going to import from our components and simply render this one now super clean just this component handles the whole part at the top we send an array of items we tell how should one item be rendered and it does the job and also listens for this one and sets it as the background Perfection that's what I call Perfection back in So now like it depends like if you want to work on the event card you go to event card if you want to work on the component the Mary component you go here and I would also encourage you to split this one in two parts in the Marquee and Marquee item oh by the way I know that the like everything should work perfectly except one simple problem and the problem is at the beginning if you go this way oh it even crashes the application but if you go this way there are no items there so in this direction you can go as much l is possible but in the other way no so not sure if it's I think it should be super easy to to fix it with some if if my head is going to my brain is going to brain today uh because it's kind of the same but in val Direction what do you think again like on the right we can scroll like for 10 years and it's going to work on the left it cannot scroll more than the beginning B way around I always confuse left with right this something normal so let's go to Mary here um let me think let me think because if we go here scroll goes in positive like from zero to one to three if we go our wave the scroll goes into negatives should it be um should we take the absolute value and not the sign value so if it's negative should we take it with positive will it have a weird Behavior or not I think it will have a weird Behavior I think it will have a weird Behavior because if I go scroll here and [Music] for example here if I do scroll value minus no the scroll should go in V Direction but probably how we work with it here for example scroll the position do I take here the absolute value of a scroll let's see what's going to happen if I do MAF dot absolute and map do absolute is going to Simply ignore the sign so in this direction everything should work as it was working but in V Direction what's going to happen I don't even know yeah if I try to yeah if I try to scroll in this direction is going to go all the way go until the beginning and then it's going to reverse the scroll Direction uh so MAF ABS here doesn't work but where will it work container with plus shift position [Music] because weave divided by container wave this divided by container Wave in My diagram is in a wave only working on this part so it's it's only adding like a a part here so if it's too much ve percentage is going to move it here but it's not working on the other way like we do not have a stop here meaning that what should happen meaning the items more than this part all right like this four for example should actually go here in this situation so yeah in our case we only have this part we do not have this part I believe so the position container with container with we cuted there anyone has any ideas it's a bit challenging so as I was saying and it's it's confusing because the scroll is in the positive direction and then the position will reverse it so yeah like if we do not consider the shift like let me put it here like the box is like this because we do not have a shift this one is like this and if we add the shift position plus shift position plus shift meaning it goes here by default and if initial position now that's at the end it works like this it calculates everything and then it shifts so what would be the calculation if it's no no no no no no you can even hear like how my brain squeaks position minus scroll view divided by that one tops there but on the other side it doesn't stop how to stop it if we start moving this way the position the in initial position plus scoll is this one okay I don't think I'm going to figure it out today if you have a solution for this and here I'm talking about covering the situation when we scroll backwards I want the previous items to to come here because it works in One Direction we can go it works in the backwards as well but when the scroll goes from positive to negative it doesn't work um yeah like the thing is that it works like the the items are moved so I think I'm not correct when I say that I have only one one I think I actually have two because otherwise from if I go all like a lot to the right and then try to go to the left it would crash but for me it doesn't crash items are moved back the only Edge case uh is when scroll goes into negative usually scroll is positive but when scroll goes into negative going into the negative in that case it crashes uh so scroll if scroll is negative if scroll if scroll is negative we should do something here initial position if this one where did they P put the math.abs because I still kind of have a feeling that it should be here maybe I put it just on the scroll value but it should be here initial position minus coll value it's Val way of abs like it's it should always be negative so maybe it's minus one multip by ABS oh let's go this is way better oh give me one second guys I need uh I need to take a call and I'll be back and we continue we have around 40 more minutes to to see what to implement so I'm going to be back e for e e e e hello guys so here we are what happened here have you seen like a lot of animations so something is happening as you can see something is happening the items are on the other end if it's negative I don't know I'm going to leave it like this and figure it out maybe later I think I'm in the right direction maybe I need to do a if statement if it's in negative I should maybe shift it like one to to the right because we saw that with that one it kind of actually worked uh but anyway like something something there is not right but like this everything is working perfect amazing I love it um uh are we going to create V screens or just the initial today I wanted really to focus on this animation and I wanted to explain it really well uh that's why we are kind of closing to the end of this live stream but a lot of you said that you are interested in building this application as a whole so let me see and most probably next week I'm going to prepare you the second part where we're going to do the rest of the screens and the back end now let me do here uh reusable uh Marky [Music] component get and maybe now uh as we have around 30 more minutes maximum maybe we can work on some of the screens that we're going to need that way is going to help us uh work only on the backend next time so other screens that we need uh I have them here so this is the the wel sorry the welcome the onboarding screen after that if you press on the create an event you are going to be redirected to this screen where you can create an event with your hosting so let's try to build this one uh for that I'm going to create a new file called create. TSX and let's export a function that will render our create screen let's import a view on the text and what I'm going to do is from the welcome screen when I press on this button I'm not going to do yeah I'm going to do on button press and I'm not going to change anything with index but I'm going to do router. push slre we can import router from from where from RE from Expo router I don't see it anyone sees router no let's do it import router from export router and now if I press create an event we are here uh from the layout I'm going to duplicate this tch. SC screen and also update the layout of our create uh screen it's also not going to have a header as we see here because it's going to have just a button and if I'm not mistaken I'm going to check it it's also going to be a presentation model so let me open invites if I do create event yes it's also coming as a model so presentation full screen model model I'm going to reload here is the create an event if I press it comes like this perfect for the beginning it has like this uh crazy um gradient we can do that by going into the create and using the linear gradient import linear gradient from Expo linear gradient come on linear gradient why doesn't want to work like this I will render this linear gradient here I will say that the colors something like that I don't know red and the style is going to be again Styles shet do absolute F this way is going to be on the full screen now that I'm working on the create screen from the index I'm not going to redirect to welcome now I'm going to actually redirect to create so that I always land on this screen back in my create I need to import sty shet from R native Styles shet and I need to do absolute field this view I need to say hey class name Flex one good uh the colors that it goes from let me try to use AI here to see if it can give me some kind of V colors uh let's do L not l k um update the gradient colors to go from red to pink purple and dark blue let's see this is the colors that it suggested and if I accept it that's going to be the one that pink doesn't look very good but if I just change it like this I think it's it's almost the same as here so I'm okay with this perfect now at the top uh there is the buttons to make sure that they are in the safe area I'm going to use a safe area view imported from safe area context at the top let's do header and the header is going to be a view that is going to have two things the button with an icon and this button preview for the icon button I'm going to do a let's do Expo Vector icon and let's find the close and design is it going to be good like what style it it it is quite bold so quite bold I'm going to do then you wantons this one so in the header I'm going to render this one I will import it from Expo Vector icons and let me check if I can give it a class name bigy red yeah I can so I will do uh BG gray something like not even gray but this one zinc and uh why is it taking all the space I don't know but I'm going to have here a button a button preview so a pressable with a text preview let's make sure to import pressable from R native and here we have it this view I'm going to give it a class name Flex row to put the items in the same row forming a row now is better and let's do justify between to put them on to our ends of screen I'm also going to give it a ping but I'm thinking should I give it at the header level or at the safe area view level because I can do it here as poding four like this and put the text create also here which I don't need now anyway back here to the icon the icon is going to be slash 20 because it's very lightly visible or 40 it's better and rounded full like this and maybe uh P2 P4 okay P4 is too much P2 is better and the color of the icon should be white similar maybe 30 here anyway when we press on this icon so on press or maybe we can put it into a link or no no no it should be on press on press what should happen is we should do router dot router dot back let's import router from export router and if I press now nothing is going to happen because we cannot go back but if I go to index and actually go back to starting from welcome screen I'm on the welcome screen I do create an event why in this case the safe area view doesn't work what's up with a safe area view I will I'll try another approach by taking the use safe area safe area insets which gives us the top and bottom so the amount of space at the top and bottom maybe I'm will take this top and instead of using safe area view I'll do a normal view but I'm going to do style equal ping top and ping bottom so now if I do create event now it works works okay that's better yeah even well not and if I do X it's going to go back perfect love it I see now like a couple of pixels that the blur view is not covering and it's bothering me so much but I'm going to try to ignore it anyway back here the Press most probably here uh is going to be enabled sometimes so pressible is going to have a class name rounded full background zinc the text is going to be text wide pting X for or even six Bing four or three and the text is going to be bold font bold something like that actually wait a second it's a bit different here it's uh think maybe 200 and the text is uh text zinc 900 and here maybe white actually and if it's not enable it can be white 40 yeah something like that but I will keep it as enable like this okay okay now what else do we have here we're going to have the add background here but then we're going to have some boxes where we're going to be able to write some some some inputs for example let me do it like this so after the header we're going to have a component uh um image picker for back ground this is going to be a view and inside of a view we're going to have an item an icon um let's try to ask uh the AI to say render an image icon from Expo Vector icon let's see okay but it should be white it it should be color can I do rgba here uh 0 0 0 one okay and I can do here 0.5 to be transparent yes so the color I think it's going to be is it 255 white 255 5 and 255 invent 0.5 to be semi-transparent maybe 0.7 yeah that's good so this view class name height 40 we full rounded no it doesn't have to be rounded and it doesn't have to have a background it just has the items to be centered and we justify Center as well okay that's good I'll do another button below this one saying add background I will add a gap for here to add spacing between them and for the background I'm going to do like as you can see here it's a very uh it's a gray or it's a black background black slash1 and the font is white slash 50 no slash 90 something like this m think I like it not going to waste time on on the background of the icon I'm going to move forward maybe just increase is the size of it like to 42 and maybe even the size of this one 64 yeah perfect and the next one is going to be this component that we see here for the event title date and location so let's go next for event uh D inputs so we're going have a view and inside the view we're going to have a couple of rows so the first one let's first of all do class name Flex one let's do a background black 10% I will do a we full and a height let's do some random number here because later we're going to adjust it where is it with full height 72 I don't need a flex probably yes okay good this 100 is going to go to 10 maybe 15 maybe it's actually going to be a blur View or does it make sense to be blur view yeah probably so let's do it as a blur view with intensity I don't think 100 but an intensity of 10 is going to be good maybe 20 maybe 10 is good and if this case background black doesn't work maybe I'm going to do a view which is going to be this black background uh BG black 20 and I'm going to wrap it around everything here and the Ping is not going to be here but on this one internal okay a and it's going to be Flex one perfect now this one is going to have B um rounded 2XL and overflow hidden maybe even like 4 Xcel do we have five Excel six I need more like why three is the maximum hidden wait a second three do we have four no do we have five no do we have six no so fre is maximum okay I'll do a shadow to excel I don't need the color for the shadow create an event Shadow large medium why it's not applied I don't see it because overflow hidden oh boy maybe we need another view on top that is going to take care of the of the Shadow class name shadow okay now it's better but I don't know if it has Shadow actually it doesn't have Shadow so I'm going to remove it but it actually looks really nice to have it may be large maybe X2 XL large let's keep it like this and it has like the the borders so the blur View that has around it has border and Border um something like gray but I like the how is it called I was using another zinc zinc 500 should be lighter 300 200 but this border is super tough border slash F I need I need like 0.5 no it doesn't work um I can apply it for Style by saying border Styles shet do hairline with border with okay now it's good and and maybe this Z like should be like this should be semi-transparent it's it's almost white zinc 200 300 gray purple 400 border wide okay white and 50% shadow kind of looks good maybe even uh 30 and what if I do B with one is too much right but if I do 10% visibility or 15% visibility MH I think this is good so I don't need the style maybe I can do simply border here which apply border one and 15% white border I can pass border one pixels but that's the Start Hair hairline with it's even smaller than one pixels so it's I need I I don't know exactly what value is that but it's the smallest wi that you can have for Border anyway we have here this one what we need is some inputs let's go ahead and Define the first input instead of this event details we're going to have uh a text uh text input uh the text input was imported for me from here and let's go ahead and give it a placeholder and the placeholder is event title event title uh the placeholder is super small I can give it like a placeholder text color if I do white here is it going to change yes so I will give it a a gray uh light gray something like that you can also play with transparency here as well um what I want to do is Let's uh let's play a little bit with class name here to style it I'll start with a background red just to see where it is okay that's good um when I type something I want it I want it to be centered so can I do here text Center I think I can can I do here text 2 XL because it's super large even like 4 XL good and I think that should be it if I remove a background light gray I don't really like the light gray I don't know I can do it like this I can even try to pick the color which I'm not sure if it's with transparency or it's just a color I believe it's with transparency so uh maybe here RGB like this yeah that's good font Boldt event title and it's a different font it's a rounded font I'm not going to do that now but if I type here go and type here I need to say that the text should be white white so if I type okay that's good now we need um we need a uh view that is going to be this Row for this input this view is going to have a border on the bottom it's going to have class name border bottom and Border color like this uh to make sure that this border connects with our one I'm not going to have any pting here I'm going to have it in this situation like this maybe even eight perfect and now it's time to do the same once more time but this time for another input and in this case the input is going to be date and time so what's going to be there an icon date and time let's do render a calendar icon okay let's accept it and below is going to be date and time so a text saying date and time perfect I'm going to put them uh at this layer I'm going to say items Center and GAP four good here I don't think I need text small font medium it's okay text wi 50 I think it's text wide actually 90 or 80 and and the icon is that's good maybe not so much spacing as V are four is enough and let's do pting for here and only pting x uh Y8 to be the same amount on the left okay and we can do once more time here and I'm going to remove the high 72 here on the whole container because it should be what height 72 I know Flex one no come on M yeah like this okay and the last one is location last one is location pin good that's it that there that's the the screen and maybe the header or the image picker here should be bigger maybe it should be one half of a screen Maybe that's not bad and with that we have uh created this one here perfect lastly we would need to store things like in the state for example the title the date and the location for the title it's super easy because the title is a text input and we can give here value title on change title but for the date um and location for date we need a date picker and for location we would need a to ask for the user location or to okay someone here wants to play with me one second Ben come come come come no you don't want okay he ran away all right so this is what we managed to do today but I'm super proud of our animation here it looks really amazing and it works really well and yeah I'm I'm pretty sure I'm going to use it in a lot of my projects that I'm going to build feel free to use it as well I'm going to leave a source code of the project in the description below um today I wanted to be more about animations um I cannot promise but maybe next week we're going to continue this project let me know in the comments if you want us to do that um to continue it and to add functionality to add the backend to make it an actual invite clone uh not only beautiful but actually functional as well uh I hope you enjoy this tutorial um make sure to check out re native master go ahead to not just the/
